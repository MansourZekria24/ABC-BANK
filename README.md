# ABC-BANK

(Intro)
The system will allow the customers and the bank staff to login into the banking system.
after logging within the system, the customer and the staff will be given a menu where they can make
a selection of money transitions, money transfers and viewing statements. 

(How its build)
I have used Object Oriented programming (OOP) and PHP for server side scripting which is the most traditional and
main target field for PHP. I have used PDO for the connection of my database as the
PDO is most secure way of connecting or accessing to my database. Bootstrap is most
popular HTML, CSS, JS framework for developing responsive web pages which I have
used for the development of the ABC Banking Application. on the other hand, as
MYSQL is an open source database is managed my Oracle, I have used it for the
development of the ABC Banking database. overall, using all of these programming
languages for developing ABC Banking Web Application was beneficial for a well
presented banking system.

(Security)
However, I have selected Client-server and object-oriented architectural style for ABC
bank project. The reason I have chosen these two is because each of these styles will
benefit me to do the project. For example, client- server benefits are it have higher
security- which it will store all the data on the server, which normally offers a better
control of security than client machines, also centralized data access- because data is
stored only on the server, access and updates to the data are far easier to manage than
in other architectural styles and simplicity of maintenance- responsibilities and roles of a
computing system are dispersed between numerous servers that are acknowledged to
each other through a network. This certifies that a client remains uninformed and
unaffected by a server repair, relocation or upgrade. 

(Hybrid Cloud)
Using the hybrid cloud within ABC bank, the ABC bank will have the flexibility and
advantages of both public as well as private cloud whereas addressing the data
security, compliance and governance. The main advantages of using the hybrid could
within the ABC bank are: Reducing costs, Improving operational efficiency and Boost
innovation.
